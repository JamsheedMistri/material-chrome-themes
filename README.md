# Material Chrome Themes
I noticed the lack of really good Material Chrome Themes available in the Chrome Web Store, so I decided to create a few of my own. They're really simple and visually appealing, and are meant for the early-2019 redesign of Chrome.

## Installation
If you want to use these themes, you'll have to go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable Developer Mode, and click "Load Unpacked" to load an unpacked extension. Select the folder corresponding to the theme you want to use, and hit "Select".

I might release these to the public in the future, but it requires a $5 payment to Google. If you'd like to see these on the Chrome Web Store, [I accept donations](https://paypal.me/JamsheedMistri)!
